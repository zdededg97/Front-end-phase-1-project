# Pokémon Explorer - Project One

Welcome to Pokémon Explorer, a simple web application that allows users to explore detailed information about Pokémon using the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

## Project Description

This project is a part of my front-end engineering course. Its main purpose is to demonstrate my expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by fetching and displaying data from the PokeAPI.

## Features

- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for specific Pokémon by their name or ID.
- **Detailed Pokémon Information:** After searching, users can view detailed information about a Pokémon such as its name, type(s), abilities, and more.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is built with a responsive design, ensuring compatibility across various screen sizes.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:** Begin by cloning this repository onto your local machine using the `git clone` command.
2. **Launch the App:** To start, simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. **Search for Pokémon:**
   - Enter the name or ID of a Pokémon into the designated search bar.
   - Click the "Search" button. This action will retrieve and display the corresponding Pokémon information.
4. **Explore Detailed Pokémon Data:**

## Technologies Utilized

- **HTML:** Structures the content of the web application.
- **CSS:** Provides stylish design and layout to the application.
